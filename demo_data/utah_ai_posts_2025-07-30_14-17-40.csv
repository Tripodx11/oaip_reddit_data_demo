Does anyone know more about these candidates than what I have listed here? I wasn't able to find much on them so I asked AI and it found even less, but not much. 

I'm leaning towards Wilson because hes against high density developments and hes a long term resident. 

I'd like to choose someone that isn't all about the money and wants to keep what we love about Holladay and not cramming in development which we dont have the infrastructure for. "

I'm terrified at this point. I've been unable to find a good-paying full-time job for months. I'm facing having to sell or throw away most of the things I've worked hard for and cherish just so I can move.

It didn't used to be like this. A family could do well on one income, then 2 for a while. Now we're having to work 3 or 4 jobs, and groceries cost more than rent or mortgage did just 10 years ago.

How do we bring things back to something like the way the middle class economy was during say FDR's time? Like, the '50s, '60s and '70s where we could afford school, health care, savings, a vacation, a retirement... it feels like we're turning into Russia, and big corporations are making more money than ever while smaller businesses and entrepreneurs are getting shut out."

Dear Senator Curtis,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to listen to the concerns of your constituents and take the time to explain your perspective on the reconciliation bill.

I understand the need for careful deliberation, and I’m encouraged to hear that you are committed to ensuring that this legislation protects critical programs and works toward fiscal responsibility. I also agree that a balanced approach that benefits communities and families is crucial.

As the bill progresses, I would like to specifically ask for your commitment to protecting our public lands. Utah’s natural landscapes are not just a cornerstone of our state’s economy and heritage—they are invaluable resources for future generations. I hope that, in your deliberations on the reconciliation package, you will firmly oppose any measures that would lead to the sale or degradation of these lands.

Could you please clarify your position on this issue? I would appreciate a follow-up response addressing your stance on protecting public lands and whether you will oppose any efforts to privatize or reduce protections for them.

Thank you again for your time and service. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best towns to stay in overnight for this route? (Highway 12 / Zion / Bryce/ Capital Reef),katokk,0,4,1743717335.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/1jqvh4b/best_towns_to_stay_in_overnight_for_this_route/,/r/Utah/comments/1jqvh4b/best_towns_to_stay_in_overnight_for_this_route/,"https://preview.redd.it/2hjskonmyose1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0c142d7f0a4e687bc4ad8dafeb4b1b28230d519

I'm planning a road trip from Chicago to LA, and decided to go through Colorado and Utah for the trip. I wanted to go through Utah's highway 12 and try to drop by some national parks as I heard its super scenic and so was planning a route based on that, but I ran into a recurring issue- there's basically only super small towns along the way that I can stay in overnight. Tentatively I've been asking chatgpt for ideas and the itinerary its giving me looks like:

Day 3: Glenwood Springs, CO > Capital Reef National Park > Torrey, UT

Day 4: Torrey, UT > Bryce Canyon National Park > Springdale , UT (next to Zion)

torrey and springdale both seem to be very small towns and I was wondering if there are other options I should be looking for?

Some alternatives I found were Escalante, UT and Bryce Canyon City, UT for day 3. Kanab, UT and Hurricane, UT for day 4.

I understand that torrey and springdale could be perfectly fine but I guess I'm just being cautious, was wondering if anyone who has done this route before had any thoughts. Was hoping to hear from others who have stayed around this area

This is all under the assumption that I would like to stay close to Zion the night of day 4, for day 3 it doesn't matter as much as long as its not a lot of driving to get there

Also I'd rather not extend the trip, the goal is to get from Glenwood springs to zion in 2 days

thank you!"

I had AI write a rebuttal to Utah House Bill 77. Your thoughts?,rs410ga,0,6,1741365078.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/1j5sp76/i_had_ai_write_a_rebuttal_to_utah_house_bill_77/,/r/Utah/comments/1j5sp76/i_had_ai_write_a_rebuttal_to_utah_house_bill_77/,"Rebuttal to Utah House Bill 77: Flag Display Amendments

The proposed Utah House Bill 77, which, among other things, seeks to prohibit the display of Pride flags in public schools on the grounds that schools should be free from sexuality, presents a flawed and inconsistent approach to the regulation of school environments. If the rationale behind banning Pride flags is to maintain a space free from sexuality, then logically, school dances should also be banned for the following reasons:

1. Inherent Expression of Sexuality: School dances, such as proms and homecomings, inherently involve expressions of romantic and sexual interest. These events often encourage students to pair up as couples, engage in close physical contact through dancing, and express romantic feelings publicly. If the goal is to eliminate any form of sexual expression from schools, then school dances, which are explicitly designed around romantic interactions, should be scrutinized and potentially banned.

2. Double Standards: Banning Pride flags while allowing school dances creates a double standard. It suggests that certain expressions of identity and sexuality are acceptable while others are not. This inconsistency undermines the principle of equality and inclusivity that public schools should uphold. If the concern is truly about maintaining a neutral environment, then all activities that involve expressions of sexuality should be treated equally.

3. Educational Value: Both Pride flags and school dances have educational value. Pride flags promote awareness and acceptance of LGBTQ+ students, fostering a supportive and inclusive environment. Similarly, school dances provide social learning opportunities, teaching students about social interactions, etiquette, and community building. Singling out Pride flags for removal ignores the positive impact they have on student well-being and inclusivity.

4. Freedom of Expression: Public schools are a place for students to learn and express themselves. Banning Pride flags infringes on students' freedom of expression and their right to celebrate their identities. If we start banning symbols that represent certain groups, we risk creating a culture of censorship and exclusion. School dances, which allow students to express themselves through music, dance, and social interaction, should also be protected under the same principle of freedom of expression.

4. Support for Marginalized Groups: Pride flags serve as a symbol of support for LGBTQ+ students, who often face higher rates of bullying and mental health challenges. Removing these symbols can send a message that their identities are not valued or accepted. School dances, on the other hand, are widely accepted and celebrated events. If the aim is to create a supportive environment for all students, then banning Pride flags while allowing school dances sends a contradictory message.

In conclusion, if the argument for banning Pride flags is to keep public schools free from sexuality, then school dances, which are inherently tied to expressions of romantic and sexual interest, should also be banned. This inconsistency highlights the need for a more thoughtful and inclusive approach to regulating school environments, one that respects the rights and identities of all students.

Utah legislative hearing on House Bill 77 (HB 77), which aims to restrict the display of certain flags in public schools and government buildings. The bill, supported by Representative Lee, seeks to maintain a politically neutral environment by limiting which flags can be flown, explicitly excluding Pride flags and other symbols not included in a predetermined list (e.g., U.S. flag, Utah state flag, military flags).


## Key Points Discussed:

Clarifications on the Bill
- The bill applies to political subdivisions, such as school districts and government buildings.
- It does not prohibit individuals (elected officials, teachers) from displaying flags in personal spaces, though a classroom as a whole is considered public space.
- If a school or government entity violates the bill, parents would first bring complaints to the state school board before pursuing legal action.


## Concerns and Arguments from Legislators

_Opposition Concerns:_
- Representative Moss questioned whether teachers displaying Pride or trans flags is actually a widespread issue.
- Representative McPherson raised concerns over vague language in Amendment 2 regarding “undermining” anti-discrimination protections.
- The ACLU and Equality Utah expressed worries about free speech violations, arguing that banning certain flags while allowing others (e.g., POW/MIA, U.S. flags) is selective and unconstitutional.

_Support Arguments:_
- Supporters argue that schools should be ideologically neutral and that Pride flags send political messages about gender and sexuality that may conflict with religious beliefs.
- Some parents expressed concerns that their children feel alienated or uncomfortable when Pride flags are displayed.


## Public Testimony

_Against the Bill:_
- LGBTQ+ advocates, students, and parents testified that Pride flags provide a sense of safety and inclusion.
- Several speakers, including a retired pediatrician, referenced the high suicide rates among LGBTQ+ youth and the potential harm of removing visible signs of support.
- One mother described how the increasing legislative attacks on LGBTQ+ students have left her transgender son isolated and fearful.
- A student argued that banning Pride flags while allowing U.S. and military flags demonstrates bias, not neutrality.

_For the Bill:_
- Some parents described discomfort with their children being exposed to Pride flags, feeling they promote a belief system that contradicts their religious or personal values.
- Others claimed Pride flags create division and that schools should be neutral spaces, displaying only government-approved flags.
- One person cited the Bible, stating that promoting LGBTQ+ identity harms children.
- A high school student recounted a conflict where LGBTQ+ symbols were protected, but police appreciation flags were vandalized.


## Legal & Enforcement Concerns

_Parental Lawsuits Against Schools:_
- Initially, the bill allowed parents to take legal action against schools that violated the flag restrictions. This raised concerns about schools and teachers facing lawsuits for something as simple as a flag in a classroom.
- An amendment was later introduced to remove this cause of action, meaning parents would first have to file complaints with the state school board rather than going straight to court.

_Ambiguity in Enforcement:_
- Some legislators questioned what would happen if a teacher refused to remove a Pride flag. Would they be fined? Fired? The bill’s supporters clarified that schools—not individual teachers—would be held accountable, though it remained unclear how enforcement would play out in practice.


## First Amendment & Free Speech Issues
	
_Government Speech vs. Individual Rights:_
- The ACLU and Equality Utah raised concerns that restricting which flags public schools and government entities can display could violate free speech protections.
- Some pointed out that government entities do have free speech rights, meaning a blanket ban on certain flags could be unconstitutional.
- One representative referenced the Tinker v. Des Moines Supreme Court case, which upheld that teachers and students do not “shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.”

_Selective Flag Bans:_
- Opponents argued that the bill was not truly neutral, as it still allowed U.S. flags, state flags, military flags, and government subdivision flags.
- Critics pointed out that these flags have political and ideological significance as well, making the bill’s claim of neutrality questionable.


## Outcome
- Several amendments were adopted, including removing a legal cause of action and clarifying that the bill does not override existing anti-discrimination protections.
- The bill passed the committee with votes largely along party lines, with Representatives Moss and Hayes voting against it.
- The next step is further legislative review before potential enactment."

How many Republicans in UT are actually Rhinos? & Gerrymandering rant,ferociouswanderer123,0,27,1722004463.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/1ecpm3s/how_many_republicans_in_ut_are_actually_rhinos/,/r/Utah/comments/1ecpm3s/how_many_republicans_in_ut_are_actually_rhinos/,"According to chatgpt:  
As of July 2024, Utah's voter registration statistics are as follows:

* **Republican**: 999,079 (904,519 active; 94,558 inactive)
* **Democratic**: 277,123 (232,002 active; 45,121 inactive)
* **Unaffiliated**: 571,547 (469,477 active; 102,071 inactive)

Other smaller parties include the Independent American Party with 86,724 total registered voters, and the Libertarian Party with 26,613 total registered voters

  
I have recently met several ""rhinos"", people who are more democrats, but register republican so they can have a say in the republican primary election-- as most Utah officials are Republican. I wonder how many of these Republicans would actually register as democrat if they felt they could have a say?

  
Also from ChatGPT:

approximately 160,000 people in Utah have come of voting age since the 2020 election.

Here is a [map](https://www.zipdatamaps.com/politics/national/districts/map-of-utah-congressional-districts) that shows the 4 districts in UT and how they are divided. Salt Lake, and the population in Salt Lake is purposefully cut into 4, leaving the democrats who live there without representation. It's an old political trick and it is disgusting.  


And while I am at it, I'm also going to complain about how prop 2 was changed. Again< according to ChatGPT:  
Utah's Proposition 2, which legalized medical cannabis, was significantly modified by the legislature after being approved by voters in November 2018. The original proposition allowed for broader access and less restrictive regulations, but following its approval, the Utah legislature passed House Bill 3001 during a special session, which introduced a number of changes to the original measure.

Key changes included:

1. **Reduction of Dispensaries**: The number of privately-run dispensaries was reduced, and the original provision allowing patients to grow their own cannabis was removed.
2. **Pharmacist Requirement**: Dispensaries were required to employ licensed pharmacists to recommend dosages.
3. **Qualifying Conditions**: The list of qualifying conditions was modified, excluding some conditions like general autoimmune disorders and chronic anxiety that were initially included in Proposition 2. The revised law also allowed for the inclusion of terminal illnesses and conditions requiring hospice care.
4. **State Oversight**: The new legislation increased state oversight and regulation of medical cannabis, including the requirement for patients to show ID and for strict dosage controls.
5. **State-run Dispensaries**: Provisions for state-run dispensaries were initially included but later repealed in a subsequent bill (SB 1002) in 2019.

These legislative changes were part of a compromise agreed upon by both proponents and opponents of Proposition 2 before the election to address concerns about regulation and implementation​.

I asked ChatGPT to generate a “paragraph” with a word count of 720 about our red rocks,Sad_Crew4030,0,0,1683431430.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/13abwyv/i_asked_chatgpt_to_generate_a_paragraph_with_a/,/r/Utah/comments/13abwyv/i_asked_chatgpt_to_generate_a_paragraph_with_a/,"The red rocks of Utah are a true testament to the power of natural forces, showcasing the incredible complexity and beauty of our planet's geological history. The formation of the red rocks began millions of years ago with the deposition of sediment and organic matter, which later underwent compression and uplift due to tectonic activity. The resulting rock layers, consisting mainly of sandstone and shale, were subjected to wind and water erosion over time, creating the unique shapes and formations we see today. The red color of the rocks is due to the presence of iron oxide, which forms when iron in the rocks is exposed to oxygen and moisture.

Despite the challenging desert conditions, the red rocks of Utah harbor a thriving ecosystem of plant and animal life. This ecosystem is adapted to the arid conditions, with species such as sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and yucca able to survive with minimal water. Meanwhile, the rocky terrain offers habitat for a diverse array of wildlife, including reptiles, small mammals, and insects. One of the most iconic species of the region is the desert bighorn sheep, whose agility and strength allow them to navigate the rocky crags and spires with ease.

The red rocks of Utah have captured the imagination of visitors from all over the world, drawing them to explore the numerous national and state parks that showcase the natural beauty of the region. These parks provide a range of recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, and rock climbing. Bryce Canyon National Park, with its towering hoodoos and spires, is a popular destination for hiking and photography, offering stunning vistas of the surrounding red rocks. Arches National Park, home to over 2,000 natural stone arches, is a testament to the power of erosion in shaping the landscape. Meanwhile, Goblin Valley State Park offers a surreal landscape of bizarre rock formations that resemble a fairy tale world.

In addition to their natural beauty, the red rocks of Utah have significant scientific value. They provide an opportunity to study the complex geological history of the region, revealing insights into the processes that have shaped our planet over millions of years. The rock layers and sedimentary formations offer a window into the distant past, providing evidence of ancient ecosystems and climatic conditions. Studying the red rocks of Utah can help us better understand the evolution of our planet and the complex interactions between geological and biological systems.

Furthermore, the red rocks of Utah are steeped in cultural significance, with a rich legacy of human history spanning thousands of years. Native American tribes have inhabited the region for millennia, leaving behind a wealth of art and cultural artifacts. Visitors can explore the ruins of ancient cliff dwellings, rock art sites, and other archaeological sites that provide insights into the lives of the people who once called this region home.

In conclusion, the red rocks of Utah are a remarkable natural wonder that provides a window into the geological, ecological, and cultural history of our planet. Exploring this unique landscape is not only a visual and intellectual experience but also a spiritual one. The red rocks of Utah are a testament to the incredible power of natural forces and the resilience of life in harsh environments, inspiring us to appreciate the beauty and complexity of our world."
