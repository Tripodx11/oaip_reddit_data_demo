"Do AI coding agents actually save you time, or just create more cleanup?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mdg6xm/do_ai_coding_agents_actually_save_you_time_or/,Forgive-My-Duck,"Ultimately it depends on the dynamic between the developer and the agent. There should be a two way communication stream where the agent would write code, and the user would confirm or make changes. I think this is how Claude Code (what I use) was intended to be used. And this holds, considering a lot of coding is really just language syntax. However, it is extremely easy to just delegate the coding completely to the agent. Then, yes, it takes forever to fix the code because you have no idea how it’s written. And to be honest, I am guilty of this…",2,1753904482.0
"Do AI coding agents actually save you time, or just create more cleanup?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mdg6xm/do_ai_coding_agents_actually_save_you_time_or/,Veraticus,"I think it depends very strongly on how you use it.

If you pair program with it, it can save you significant time; it writes code much faster than I do personally, can use reference material far more rapidly, and I can corral it to do the proper thing if I see it going off-track. This process is like coding with a semi-lobotomized mid or senior programmer, who is superb at syntax, composition, and research but struggles to stay on task or make the correct architectural decisions.

For example, I was fixing a Kubernetes controller we use, and I cloned all the Kubernetes API machinery stuff for it to use as a reference. It crawled through the reference code and completed an implementation that would have taken me hours of research in just minutes.

If you give it a very specific task and a plan for implementing it, it still saves you time but you have to review all its output afterwards and correct it. It does have a tendency to create double implementations or make less-than-optimal architectural solutions, and you have to catch those before shipping. You can just point it to the bad parts and tell it what you want, though, and it will fix them. 

If you give it a generic task and don't pay attention to it, you are in for disaster. So, unfortunately, the typical vibe-coding workflow.",1,1753905379.0

Your `manager` `sub-agent` would need to have a dexterous `description` and `system prompt` detailing when he needs to invoke his employees!
