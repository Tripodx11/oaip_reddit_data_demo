I just can't. All those ideas, all those projects stored in the back of my mind, coming to life as working prototypes in hours. It is insane. Two days ago I made a migration of a forum from a shit platform to a custom nuxt+supabase setup and it just works and it is better than the original.

I tried quitting... Always came back for whatever reasons. Having a llm that have access to your computer is too much powerful and addictive. There is no friction anymore. Everything is more fluid and fun. Even with the casual hallucinations. Nothing compare to cc actually.,4,1753896359.0

It's okay though. You don't feel guilty about being addicted to:

1. Your cellphone, which you probably use to browse the web, talk to people, and listen to music
2. Electricity, which you use every day in so many tasks you just take it for granted
3. Your IDE, without which you would be massively slower at coding

Inevitably, when using conveniences you become dependent on them. I don't think that's necessarily bad. We COULD live without cellphones/electricity/IDEs if necessary. But happily it isn't.",4,1753895245.0

My prompts are typically 2+ paragraphs with a directive to break down everything withhin, and put what I've told it into a detailed .md file.


I can essentially be extremely detailed to the point that after it establishes the directives/conventions that when it gets to the detailed task phase, I can just do:


'Alright, now with the conventions and directives established in this session, proceed and embed the directives and conventions in codefile comments and track what you do in a .MD file as you progress. Proceed.'


Then, up arrow and enter, in order to queue the prompt again.


If I'm super feisty ill add a 'if you can, decide the simplest practical option based on our project's .MD files' to that message and up arrow + enter to queue.


Hasn't failed me for the past 10 prompts.",1,1753899797.0
